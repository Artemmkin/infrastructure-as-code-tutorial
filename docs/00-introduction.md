# Introduction

Let's dream for a little bit...

Imagine that you're a young developer who developed a web application. You run and test your application locally and everything works great, which makes you very happy. You believe that this is going to blow the minds of Internet users and bring you a lot of money.

Then you realize that there is a small problem. You ask yourself a question: "How do I make my application available to the Internet users?"

You're thinking that you can't run the application locally all the time, because your old laptop will become slow for other tasks and will probably crush if a lot of users will be using your app at the same time. Besides, your ISP changes randomly the public IP for your router, so you don't know on which IP address your application will be accessible to the public at any given moment.

You start realizing that the problem you're facing is not as small as you thought. In fact, there is a whole new craft for you to learn in IT world about running software applications and making sure they are always available to the users.

The craft is called **IT operations**. And in almost every IT department, there is an operations (Ops) team who manages the platform where the applications are running.

The tutorial you are about to begin will give you, a young developer, a bit of a glance into what operations work look like and how you can do this work more efficiently by using **Infrastructure as Code** approach.
